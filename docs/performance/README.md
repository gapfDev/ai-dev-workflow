# Kanban Performance Work Structure

This folder is the execution workspace for:
- Milestone: **Milestone 2 - Kanban Performance Upgrade (10x Faster)**
- Epic: **#24 - Kanban 10x Faster: Master Execution Tracker**

## Purpose
Provide one clear place to plan, execute, measure, and validate all Kanban performance changes.

## Folder Map
- `execution-order.md`: ordered path and ticket mapping.
- `phases/`: implementation checklist per phase.
- `contracts/`: API and frontend contracts for performance paths.
- `benchmarks/`: baseline and run reports.
- `rollout/`: feature flags, canary, and rollback playbooks.
- `final-handoff.md`: closure summary, evidence, and follow-up backlog.
- `../../tools/performance/`: scripts and helpers for perf checks.

## Rules
1. Update the corresponding phase file when a ticket starts/completes.
2. Attach benchmark evidence for all performance-impacting changes.
3. Keep ticket links and acceptance criteria in sync with GitHub issues.
