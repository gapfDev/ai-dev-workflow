# TECHNICAL STRATEGY

## 1. Architecture
- **Paradigm**: Agentic Parallel Trees.
- **Backend Environment**: TypeScript ecosystem.

## 2. Mitigations
- Implementing explicitly a `File CLAIM Protocol` as instructed by the human.
- The `Checkout_Agent` will be forced to wait for `Cart_Agent` to release `OrderService.ts` before writing.
